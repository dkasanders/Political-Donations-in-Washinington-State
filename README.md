# Political Fundraising Analysis in Washington State

## Overview

Analysed political donations in Washington State to get insights on where Democrats and Republicans outperform one another.

## Data
- Source: State of Washington Open Data Portal, [Contributions to Candidates and Political Committees](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/contributions-to-candidates-and-political-committees)
- Data ranges from 2008 - 2025. For the sake of this project, I looked at data from 2008 - 2024 to better analyse election cycles.

## Methods
- Data cleaning and validation
- Exploratory data analysis via histograms and linear regression
- Statistical testing (t-test) for average donation comparison
- Categorization of elections in "high-profile" vs "low-profile"

## Key Findings
- Democrats consistently outfundraise Republicans, both in total raised and number of unique donations.
- In high-profile races, Democrats outperform in fundraising.
- Republicans tend to give larger individual donations, and perform better in local elections.

## Report
